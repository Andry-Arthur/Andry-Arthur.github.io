<h1>Fine header</h1>
<p>
This is a test exercise
</p>
<p>
A paragraph of text.
Whatever line wrapping that is present in the
file                                   or lots
of extra spaces in the file are generally ignored
and the text is re-wrapped based on the width 
of browser.
</p>
    <p>You can add a style like <strong>bold</strong>
    to some text by enclosing it in the <em>appropriate</em>
    tag.
</p>
<p>
    You can even mark some text so that it is a 
    <a href="lists.htm">link to another page</a>.
</p>

<pre>If you        use the pre tag
   The browser respects spaces
and
line
ends
        and shows the text in a
        monospace font.

</pre>

<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue">blue</span> eyes.</p>
